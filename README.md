Bamazon homework assignment

These apps work with a mySQL database and tables.

The biggest challenge I had with this assignment was the JOIN and GROUP SQL statements. I learned there's a setting in mySQL which requires primary id's to be included as part of the GROUP statement. Once I included department_id as part of the GROUP statement the table started working.

The easiest thing I found was using console.table.
